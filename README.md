# CARD (Central African Radiocarbon Database)

*[Dirk Seidensticker M.A. (University of Cologne)](https://uni-koeln.academia.edu/DirkSeidensticker)*

The *Central African Radiocarbon Database* (CARD) aims at delivering a reliable and free to use dataset containing all available radiocarbon datings from Central Africa. Contributions are highly welcome.

The [CARD-Webapp](https://dirkseidensticker.shinyapps.io/webapp/) will help you to explore the dataset.

## Structure of the Repository

| Folder | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| /data | Contains the dataset itself as well as a description (.md file) |
| /Python | Examples of Python-Code |
| /R | Examples of R-Code  |
| /webapp | Files for a Shiny-Webapp which helps to explore the dataset | 


## Roadmap and ToDo's

* Deploy and refine the Shiny-App (Code inside /webapp) which delivers a first easy-to-use interface
* Deploy R-Code which covers the same steps as the Python-Code
* Including the CARD-dataset into the [radiocarbon3/neolithicR-pakage](https://github.com/nevrome/neolithicR) of [Clemens Schmid](https://github.com/nevrome)
